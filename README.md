# Antipheromone_Offline
The offline (i.e. non-interactive) antipheromone NetBeans Project, originally for GECCO 2016 (2015 Paper 42)

This project set up 25 July 2016, as a repository for the Antiphermone NetBeans Java project. The source code was developed over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the GECCO paper was submitted in January 2016. 

This repository is intended for an offline, batch-mode i.e. non-interactive, Ant Colony Optimisation (iACO) source code using antipheromone. There are number of 'main()' methods to choose - make sure it's the 'batch-mode' one.
